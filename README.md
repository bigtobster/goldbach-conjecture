# goldbach-conjecture
Algorithm that "proves" the Goldbach Conjecture up to Java's INTEGER.MAX.

There are 2 algorithms. 1 which has a limit of Java's INTEGER.MAX and the other which has a limit of Java's LONG.MAX. 

Note that this algorithm is computationally intensive and will take some time to completely execute!
